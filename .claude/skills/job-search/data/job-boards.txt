# Job Boards Database
# Simple starting list - will expand as we discover what works

## Currently Using
Stepstone | https://www.stepstone.com/

## Context Notes (To inform search strategy)
- Location: Thailand (remote work required)
- Open to: International companies, remote-first orgs
- Markets to consider:
  - International (primary)
  - Thai companies (minimal AI/ML market - low priority)
- High-value targets: Major AI companies (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.)
- Contract work: Open to longer-term freelance (chatbot/voicebot design)

## To Be Determined Through Iteration
- Which markets work best for remote applicants from Thailand
- Best job boards for each market/domain
- Search strategies that surface quality opportunities
- How to filter for remote-friendly companies

## Will Add As We Discover
(Space for new boards as we test and validate what works)
