# Find Employers Workflow

**Status:** INITIAL PROPOSAL - Will iterate interactively

## Goal
Identify potential employers posting AI/ML/Voice AI roles suitable for remote work from Thailand.

## Current Approach (PLACEHOLDER)

This is a starting point. We'll refine this as you go through the actual process.

### Step 1: Determine search strategy
- Which job boards to check (Stepstone, Indeed, Upwork, others)
- Which markets/regions to target (international, specific countries)
- Search terms to use
- Remote work filters

### Step 2: Execute searches
(Manual initially - will automate as we learn what works)

### Step 3: Extract company names
(To be determined - what format works best?)

### Step 4: Initial filtering
(Criteria to be defined based on what you discover)

## Context to Consider

**Your situation:**
- Location: Thailand (remote required)
- Open to international companies
- Open to freelance/contract (longer-term chatbot/voicebot projects)
- High-value targets: Major AI companies worth pursuing

**Markets:**
- International (primary focus)
- Thai market (minimal - low priority)

**Questions to answer through iteration:**
- Which job boards actually show remote-friendly opportunities?
- How to filter for companies that hire internationally?
- What search terms surface the best matches?
- How to identify quality opportunities vs noise?

## Next Steps

1. You'll manually search on Stepstone/Indeed/Upwork
2. We'll observe what works and what doesn't
3. We'll refine this workflow based on actual experience
4. We'll automate the parts that become repetitive

## Notes

- Start with manual exploration
- Document what works
- Build automation incrementally
- This workflow will evolve significantly
