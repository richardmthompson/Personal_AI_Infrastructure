## Content Repurposing Strategy

### The Anchor → Derivative Model

**Step 1: Create Monthly Anchor Content (3-4 hours)**

- Long-form blog post (1,500-2,500 words) OR
- YouTube video (15-25 minutes)

**Step 2: Repurpose into 10+ Derivative Pieces (2-3 hours)**

```
BLOG POST (1,500 words)
    ↓
    ├─→ X Thread (7-10 tweets): Key insights
    ├─→ X Standalone Tweets (3-5): Individual lessons
    ├─→ LinkedIn Post (1,000 words): Professional framing
    ├─→ LinkedIn Carousel: Visual breakdown
    ├─→ Code Snippets (2-3): Ray.so screenshots
    ├─→ Short YouTube Clip (3-5 min): Extract from longer video
    └─→ TIL Posts (2-3): "Today I Learned" format

YOUTUBE VIDEO (20 minutes)
    ↓
    ├─→ Blog Post: Transcript + refinement
    ├─→ X Thread: Video summary + link
    ├─→ LinkedIn: Behind-the-scenes story
    ├─→ YouTube Shorts (3-5): Key moments
    ├─→ GIFs: Demo highlights for X
    └─→ Code Repo: GitHub with README
```

## Key Principles to Remember

1. **Start small, stay consistent**: 3 posts/week beats 7 posts/week that burns you out in 2 months

2. **Repurpose ruthlessly**: 1 hour of anchor content → 10+ derivative pieces

3. **Batch for efficiency**: Create week's content in 2-3 focused sessions, not daily

4. **Document, don't create extra**: Your daily work IS your content

5. **Engage authentically**: Reply to every comment, build real relationships

6. **Quality over vanity metrics**: 100 engaged followers > 1,000 passive followers

7. **Old school hacker ethos**: Share value, be helpful, build community—not just self-promotion

8. **Sustainability first**: If it's not sustainable at month 3, it won't work at month 12
