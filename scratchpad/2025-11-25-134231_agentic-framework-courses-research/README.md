# Research: Agentic Framework Courses (LangChain/LangGraph & CrewAI)

**Date:** 2025-11-25
**Research Mode:** Standard (9 agents)
**Agents Used:** 3 perplexity-researcher, 3 claude-researcher, 3 gemini-researcher

## Research Question

What courses are available to deeply learn either LangChain/LangGraph or CrewAI, in-depth, end-to-end, and in order to build production agentic systems? Preferably free.

## Key Findings

### Top 4 Free Courses (High Confidence)
1. **LangChain Academy - Introduction to LangGraph** (100% free, 6 hours, 55 lessons)
2. **Coursera: Agentic AI with LangChain and LangGraph** (IBM, free audit, 4.7/5 rating)
3. **DeepLearning.AI - AI Agents in LangGraph** (Free, taught by framework creators)
4. **Coursera: Multi-Agent Systems with CrewAI** (DeepLearning.AI, free audit)

### Framework Recommendation
- **Start with LangChain/LangGraph** for deep fundamentals and production systems
- **Then learn CrewAI** for rapid prototyping and intuitive development
- **Common pattern:** Prototype with CrewAI → Productionize with LangGraph

### Learning Path
- **Quick start:** 2-4 hours (LangChain Academy intro)
- **Comprehensive:** 12 weeks (full mastery path)
- **Proficiency:** 4-6 weeks with daily practice

## Methodology

- **Query decomposition:** 9 focused sub-questions (3 per agent type)
- **Parallel execution:** All 9 agents launched simultaneously
- **Research time:** ~3 minutes
- **Cross-validation:** Multiple source verification for confidence levels

### Agent Distribution
- **Perplexity (3 agents):** Web/current information - courses, platforms, tutorials
- **Claude (3 agents):** Academic/detailed - learning paths, curriculum, comparisons
- **Gemini (3 agents):** Multi-perspective - developer recommendations, communities, certifications

## Output Files

- **research-report.md** - Full comprehensive report with all findings, learning paths, and recommendations
- **README.md** (this file) - Research documentation and metadata

## Research Metrics

- **Total Agents:** 9
- **Total Queries:** ~18-27
- **Services Used:** 3 (Perplexity API, Claude WebSearch, Gemini Research)
- **Total Output:** ~15,000+ words
- **Confidence Level:** High (85%)
- **Result:** Multiple high-quality free courses exist for comprehensive production-ready training

## Notes

- All courses verified as free or free-to-audit as of November 2025
- Official sources prioritized (LangChain Academy, Coursera, DeepLearning.AI)
- Community resources include Discord servers with 12K-86K+ members
- GitHub repositories provide hands-on practice opportunities
