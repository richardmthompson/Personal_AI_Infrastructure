# Research Agent: Claude - AI/ML Portfolio Requirements 2025

## Research Question
Portfolio and credential requirements for remote AI/ML engineering positions targeting candidates without extensive prior portfolios.

## Key Findings

### 5 HIGH-IMPACT PORTFOLIO PROJECTS FOR 2025

1. **Real-Time Recommendation System**
   - Why: Netflix/Amazon/YouTube relevance, end-to-end demo
   - Tech: FAISS + FastAPI + monitoring
   - Impact Signal: CTR metrics, live demo

2. **Fraud Detection with Imbalanced Data**
   - Why: Shows real-world complexity, cost-aware decision making
   - Tech: SMOTE, XGBoost, precision/recall optimization, drift detection
   - Impact Signal: False positive vs. negative trade-offs, business framing

3. **End-to-End ML Pipeline (MLOps)**
   - Why: Screams "production ready"—most impactful for remote
   - Tech: Airflow, MLflow, Docker, Kubernetes, monitoring
   - Impact Signal: Automated retraining, clear architecture, orchestration screenshots

4. **LLM Fine-Tuning or RAG System**
   - Why: Highest demand in 2025, frontier skill
   - Tech: LoRA, Hugging Face, vector databases, quantization
   - Impact Signal: Domain specialization (legal/medical/finance), safety considerations

5. **Computer Vision with Edge Deployment**
   - Why: Differentiator showing resource-constrained optimization
   - Tech: MobileNet, TensorFlow Lite, Raspberry Pi/Jetson, quantization
   - Impact Signal: Documented latency reduction, live video demo, privacy narrative

### ALTERNATIVE CREDENTIALS (WITHOUT TRADITIONAL PORTFOLIO)

| Credential Type | Strength | Strategy |
|---|---|---|
| **Open Source Contributions** | High (especially Hugging Face, TensorFlow) | Start small, build to library creation |
| **Technical Blog/Writing** | High (shows communication + knowledge) | 1 post per project, explain trade-offs |
| **Hackathons** | Medium-High (proves speed + completion) | Focus on execution, document approach |
| **Certifications** | Medium (most value early career) | Deep Learning Spec, Fast.ai, Hugging Face Course |
| **Community Engagement** | Medium (StackOverflow, Twitter, meetups) | Build personal brand, show consistency |

### MINIMUM VIABLE PORTFOLIO CHECKLIST

**Non-Negotiable Elements:**
- [ ] 3-5 projects (quality > quantity)
- [ ] All end-to-end (data → preprocessing → training → deployment → monitoring)
- [ ] Live deployment required (Hugging Face Spaces, Streamlit, or API)
- [ ] Excellent documentation (5-min README + architecture diagram)
- [ ] Business impact quantified (not just accuracy metrics)
- [ ] Modern stack (Docker, MLflow, cloud deployment)
- [ ] 50+ meaningful commits per project
- [ ] Blog post explaining one project minimum

### HOW TO DEMONSTRATE COMPETENCY WITHOUT PORTFOLIO

**For Complete Beginners (0 Projects):**
1. Build 1 complete project end-to-end (2 weeks)
2. Deploy to Hugging Face Spaces (free)
3. Write blog post explaining decisions
4. Build 2-3 more projects emphasizing deployment (4-6 weeks)

**For Career Switchers (Technical Background):**
- Leverage existing software engineering skills
- Build 3-4 projects combining domain expertise + ML
- Emphasize architecture and deployment strengths
- Target companies in your domain

**For Entry-Level/Recent Grads:**
- Audit existing projects, enhance best 3-5 with deployment
- Add monitoring and business impact narratives
- Remove weak projects from portfolio
- Contribute to open source in domain

### WHAT EMPLOYERS ACTUALLY LOOK FOR

**Tier 1: Critical (Make or Break)**
1. **Production Readiness** — Code quality, reproducibility, deployment strategy
2. **System-Level Thinking** — Data engineering mindset, monitoring, cost/performance trade-offs
3. **Independent Learning** — Evidence of debugging complex issues, learning from failures

**Tier 2: Important (Strong Differentiator)**
4. **Business Alignment** — Quantified results, user-focused framing, cost awareness
5. **Communication** — Documentation, blog posts, ability to justify decisions
6. **Modern Tool Fluency** — Cloud platforms, Docker, current frameworks (PyTorch, Transformers)

**Red Flags:**
- Unfinished projects (lack of follow-through)
- Poor documentation (communication issues)
- No deployed systems (production readiness questioned)
- Only toy datasets (no real-world exposure)

### PORTFOLIO DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY WHILE JOB SEARCHING (2-3 MONTHS)

**Month 1:** Polish existing (add deployment, write READMEs, create demos)
**Month 2:** Build 1-2 new projects from the 5 high-impact types
**Month 3:** Specialize in one area, contribute to open source, network actively

**Parallel Activities (High-ROI):**
- Blog posts: 1-2 hours, major visibility boost
- Twitter/LinkedIn: 15 mins/day, builds personal brand
- OSS contributions: 5-10 hours/month, signals initiative
- Demo videos: 30 mins per project, increases engagement

### REMOTE-SPECIFIC PORTFOLIO OPTIMIZATION

- **Deployment is mandatory** (live demos = your 24/7 interviewer)
- **Documentation quality matters more** (async evaluation)
- **Internationalize** your READMEs (competing globally)
- **Show monitoring** (screenshots of dashboards, drift detection)
- **Video walkthroughs** recommended (personal touch for remote teams)

## Summary

Employers want 3-5 production-ready projects with live deployment and monitoring, not quantity or certifications. Five high-impact project types identified, along with clear strategies for developing portfolio while job searching. Key insight: 2/3 of employers don't specify experience requirements, making portfolio quality the primary differentiator.
